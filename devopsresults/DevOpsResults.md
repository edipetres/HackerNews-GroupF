**2. Analysis of feedback**

Our operational documentation appears sufficient for the work of a DevOps team. Also, it is perceived as very appropriate and very accurate to the majority of the team. Therefore, we can assume we have described our product well. Nevertheless, “sufficient” is not enough for it to be perfect to follow.

We asked the participants in the questionnaire to provide what they think is good and not so good about the documentation. They have pointed out our short style of writing and describing our toolstack and database well as positives, but lack of details and information about our API-endpoints, as well as the order of the information presented in our documentation on the negative side. Moreover, the team find description of progress lacking as the progress on the project has gone further.

Asking for suggestions to make the documentation easier to follow, we got the impression that we need to use more graphs/schemes/models/diagrams to bring more visualisation to our presentation, update the documentation more frequently and bring more insight into our decision-making of technology choices.

All in all, on the scale of 1 to 10 they find the documentation helpful on the average of 6.66. Thus, with following some of the pointers of the DevOps team, like frequently updating and reflecting on our progress and putting in more visual details, we would be able to get the DevOps team’s satisfaction of documentation to the higher end.


**3. Changes to our documentation**

We have changed our toolstack information to get it up to date with the progress we have made, also we have written down some of our choices concerning ‘releases’ for example.

Less than a day for all the DevOps members to answer it.

3.Short descriptions

What do you find least helpful and why?3 responses
1.General just a lack of deeper details.
2.API-endpoints documentation is missing
3.Confusing ordering of info

Is there any information related to the operational documentation that you find lacking?(please add as many entries as you need)1 response
1.Toolstack (like the generel document) has not been updated to reflect the almost 3 weeks of progress made to the project.

Any suggestions that would help the documentation to be easier to follow?3 responses
1. Documentation of the API's.
While progress has been made on the project itself, there has been no update to the documentation readme (as of this survey-entry) for 18 days.
Spent most of my time going through the project Repo and source-files to learn about the project, rather than reading the documentation.
More models/Diagrams.
More insight into choices and decisions, why what tools was used vs. other tools?
2. Using more Schemes/graphs
3. It's generally fine!
